additional package to install for candlehoarder in raspi

sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

Add to requitements.txt in github

Also renamed secrets.py to private.py since it clashed with another module suddenly and caused this error

ImportError: Unable to import required dependencies:
numpy: cannot import name randbits

Had to rename secrets to private in config.py sections too!!

ANother additional package to install:

sudo apt-get install libopenjp2-7-dev
